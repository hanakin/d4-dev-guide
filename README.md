# Diablo IV Game Development Guide
Community curated game dev outlines for Blizzard's Diablo IV

The intent of this repo is to house detailed outlines for alll the various features for Diablo IV. The intent being that the community can provide, vote, review changes to each feature to help generate a solid set of ideads to guide the Developers in making decisions to end up with the game we want and deserve.

## How it works

Each aspect of the game will have a file dedicated to outlining the requirments for a feature nessecary with detailed descriptions, comparisons, examples and suggestions.

- There is will be a **MAIN** forum post containing a compiled post of all the content generated in this repo which is duplicated on reddit. 
- Each feature will have a dedicated reddit post for disscussing it.
- The post will contain the current contents of the toipc file and be kept uptodate with the contents of this repo.
- The **MAIN** post will link to each of these individual feature redit posts. As such the reddit posts will each link to the source file in this repo as well as the **MAIN** post. 
- All disscussions comments can then be up/down voted to establish consensus on certain topics.
- Anyone can then post suggested changes to each topic through pull requests/issues on here.
- Based on the disscussions on the redit posts and here. The maintainers of this repo can then comment/approve/reject any of the suggested changes(pull requests) on here.

## Fighting Bias
We all have our biases. Personnally I come from the days of D2 and prefer alot about it over D3 for example. Inorder to attempt to  fight bias and keep an open mind. The community will vote on who should be a maintainer. Basically who should be apart of the final decision to what gets approved/rejected. This will also be hanndled via an issue on here. First create an issue on here suggesting a vote for someone containing a link to the reddit users profile and a straw pool. must result in a 20% higher positive vote.

The maintainers should however be limited. For now possibly four. The removal of a maintainer will be upto the maintainers however. I **hanakin** will provide any tie breaking vote.

## Suggesting Topics
**[CURRENTLY CLOSED]**

Suggesting new topics will be handled via issues. Propose the topic via an issue. It should include the inital outline from your perspective. The maintainers will then flesh out all the requirments if determiend that its benifitial based on comment responses on the issue.

Hopefully this all works and hopefully blizzard is actually open to taking the communities feedback.
