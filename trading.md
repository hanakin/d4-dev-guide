# Trading & Economy

Trading is a core component of any ARPG. It not only fostrers an ability to garner upgrades to for that build you are striving to complete. It also plays a huge role in the communication and social netwroking within the game. Helping to establish and build its evolving community. And ultimately the driving force behind the ecomy the game flows around.

All of this needs to be taken into consideration when planing out just how a trading system is implemented.

On th other side of the spectrum traing can contribute to the negative aspects of a game as well. Such as scaming, external black markets, botting, and more.

### Diablo II system

#### Pros
1. Provide critical networking for the game leading to many new relationships.
2. Free to trade any item bar 2 or 3. Leading to far more diversity in builds
3. Provide a much better social aspect to cleaning out your inventory via free item games...
4. Socail sharing of gear amongst friends and clanmates.
5. More game type varity spawned from creatvity around dropping items on ground exp: "Hide and Seek", "Free if wait" games etc...
6. Currency = runes or soj which are useful at any stage of the game and not just early on such as gold. 

#### Cons
1. Third party suction houses
2. Add bots
3. Scamming

### Diablo III system

#### Pros
1. No third party sites
2. No Bots
3. Less scamming

#### Cons
1. Auction house "Pay to Win"
2. Bound items limit possabilities
3. No ecomony to trade
4. No social netwroking at all.
5. No game type variety
6. No good currency after the removal of the auction house. (gold and gems were curecny prior to the removal of the suctionhouse but after it was removed there was no consistent currency)

Looking at these sees a complete polar oposite to them. A balance should be found and to be honest the cons with d@'s system could have been patched in some way rather than flipping the script. So what might that look like.

### Proposed system
1. Open trading but with controls and limits
2. No bound items bar 1-5 total max!
3. Dropping on ground needs to be a thing but with limits
4. Teired items (based on a combination of ilvl, quality and type) not just one of these but more complex. Should be tyed to the economy.

What does this look like.

All items found in game can be shared with anyone in that game/party until the user who found it logs out of the server. The concept of a private invite only hideout needs to be established to provide private secure area for trading since towns will be public in D4 from the looks of it. Primary currency should not be gold but instead item based similar to how the Path of Exile system works based on crafting items. This provides for a better long term economy then gold which just ends of being useless at higher levels and ultimately a waste of time performing meaning less tasks. A trade tax/friendship system similar to pokemon go should be implimented based on a scaling factor ie starts at 100% and scales to 0% based on meeting certain achievements and the item teir. ie # hours played together in a party, being friends scaled by length of friendship, being clanmates based on length or role within the clan, etc... Tax should also not be gold but based on the established currency by the community/economy! With this in mind the items dropped on ground should also only be visible to the individual when partied, in hideout/private areas, when no tax is required for said item based on teir, or if partied and just found in current game.

#### Rough Exp:
```
Lets say that we have currency = 1-5
There are maybe 10 teirs of items
1 = Free to trade
2 = Free to trade with party (10 hrs)/friends (10hrs)/clanmates (10hrs) else 1 currency
3 = free to trade with party (15 hrs)/friends (10hrs)/clanmates (10hrs) else 1 currency
4 = free to trade with party (20 hrs)/friends (15hrs)/clanmates (15hrs) else 2 currency
5 = free to trade with party (48 hrs)/friends (1 week)/clanmates (1 week) else 2 currency
6 = free to trade with party (1 week)/friends (3 week)/clanmates (3 week) else 3 currency
7 = free to trade with party (1 month)/friends (1.5 Months)/clanmates (1.5 months) else 3 currency
8 = free to trade with party (3 months)/friends (6 Months)/clanmates (6 months) else 4 currency
9 = free to trade with party (6 months)/friends (9 Months)/clanmates (9 months) else 5 currency
10 = account bound
```

### Proposal Summary
1. Scaling tax/friendship system
2. Private invite only hideout
3. crafting item based currency (No Gold, infact remove gold!)
4. Teired items based on economy value
5. Open trading
6. Dropped item hiding/filtering based on tax/friendship system and when found
7. trade/drop anything found in current game with party memebers as long as in a private area.

#### Pros
1. Third party sites, scammers, bots would have trouble navigating the taxs and users would be less likely to do the trade outside of estblished methods due to higher costs
2. Provide critical networking for the game leading to many new relationships.
3. Free to trade any item bar 2 or 3. Leading to far more diversity in builds
4. Provide a much better social aspect to cleaning out your inventory
5. Socail sharing of gear amongst friends and clanmates.
6. More game type varity spawned from creatvity around dropping items on ground exp: "Hide and Seek", "Free if wait" games etc...
7. Currency = runes or soj which are useful at any stage of the game and not just early on such as gold. 

#### Cons
1. More complicated
2. Not sure open for disscussion.
