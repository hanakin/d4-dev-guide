# Lets Make Diablo Great for Years to Come!

### Preface
Blizzard said they are looking to be more open and interactive going forward with the development of Diablo IV. If this is true lets put the community to work facilitating this.

### Intent
First this is going to be a very long post detailing all the individual features that comprise an ARPG like Diablo. While it will start as my opinions and suggestions, the goal is to update and change things to reflect the consensus based on all the feedback. In turn this can be used by the devs to garner insights and crowd source polished and refined suggestions.

### The How
Stay with me this may sound complicated. First this will be post both on the forums and the reddit since there are different users on both. Each of the features will contain detailed outlines with comparisons between D2 & D3 as well as references to other franchise ARPGs. They will also more importantly provide a suggested way forward for the feature.

For this to work initaly these will all be written by me bsed on my perspective, but the intent is to capture feedback from the community with suggested changes and disscussion, which I will inturn be able to incorporate and update the feature write-ups. Inorder to make this as democratic and easy to maintain. All of the feature write-ups are written individualy and host in a github repo.

Each feature will have its own reddit thread for disscussion. With the ability to submit changes and issues against the github for review/disscussion/voting/inclusion going forward. For more specific details chacke the wiki found here.

I will be adding more features as we go so check back soon. If you have suggestions for features not covered here then submit an issue on the github repo. More on this can be found on the wiki.

Hopefully this pans out. And we can then get it in front of the various streamers to also highlight and provide there feedback to capture as well as get it in the hands of the developers.

### My Background
Before we dive into the features a little about me. I have been plaing Diablo games since my first year of college back in 2000. I got my start with Diablo 2 and immediately fell in love. I continued to play the crap out of the game until Diablo 3 was released at which I transitioned over. I put countless hours into both games since I started.

I would have to say that I am more of a fan of Diablo 2 but that is not to say that there are not advantages/disadvantages to both games. I just find that Diablo 2 has more advantages and less disadvantages for me than Diablo 3. The main thing reason being replay ability mostly steming from the social aspects of the games. I will get into all the specifics in more detail but just please take this all in mind when responding to anything. 

That all being said, please do not flame your opinion. Everyone is intitled to there opinion and choice of game play. Instead of just saying this game sucked or this was obviously better, please aim to provide constructive adult disscussions to get to the bottom of what it is we want out of Diablo IV.

Lastly I do not begin to claim that I am by any means an expert or authority. I am not always right so please helpme make this something highly useful. If you do not agree with something I say then prove me wrong.
